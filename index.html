            <h2>Scratch Racing Game</h2>
            <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/173588241/">Racing Game</a></p>
            <p>In this game two players race to see who can make it to the finish line first. In this activity I learned how to control a character with keys. A challenge I had was the arrangement of the buttons when the track changed. To control the red car use the arrow keys and to use the green cars use the WASD keys. If you go into the grass you explode and restart the race.
Click on the blue buttons to go to their corresponding tracks.</p>

                <p>In this project you can draw a mandala to your specifications. Use the buttons to set the number of sides and how long each is, and then click the "Draw Mandala" button to draw it. This project was written in snap blocks. A challenge my teammate and I was to make the Mandala into a closed shape instead of making a shape that is not a mandala. </p>

                <h2>Congressional Drawing App</h2>
                <p><a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/project?user=rafael%20torres&project=Jose%20%26%20Rafael%20Drawing%20App">Drawing App</a></p>
                <p>In this project you can use differnet tools to draw freehand or draw specific shapes. In the app you can click on the different pull out menus to select the different tools. In the pencil tape there is the pencil tool and the eraser tool. In the polygon tab you can click on the respective buttons to select the number of sides and the radius of the shape you want to draw. In the points tab you can use the respetive buttons to select points in the screen and then connect them to make your own shapes. The settings tab allows you to select the lineweight of all the tools in the app. This app was written with snap blocks. A problem we had was that al the different tools would conflict with each other breaking the app. Another problem we had was to make the tools always follow the mouse pointer. My teammate and I came up with several versions of the features in the app until we fond the ones that could coexist with the others. </p>
